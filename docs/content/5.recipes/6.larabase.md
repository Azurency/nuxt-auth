# Larabase

Here we document the procedure one *should* follow when hooking up `nuxt-auth` with the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) [`Passport` package](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/passport).

The procedure can be broken down into two steps.

0. Setting the environment

Best practice to communicate important data to the backend are environment vars as you probably already know.
Here we basically set the needed data in order to make this auth flow work correct.

In you `.env` you set the following:
```
CUSTOM_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000"
CUSTOM_BACKEND_NAME="larabase"
CUSTOM_BACKEND_ID="9840bca9-2a9c-4f35-be1f-7450f889e7a7"
CUSTOM_CLIENT_ID="9840bca9-2cfd-47bb-9643-8297d3db99c9"
CUSTOM_CLIENT_SECRET="rqgiq1yfDszZNvvqzYHnYv16ohuhrKO6oGaIo1uj"
```

This step is of corse not necessarily required.

1. Adding a custom `OAuth` provider in Laravel `Passport`

In order to be able to interact with your custom auth flow, you have to generate a Laravel `Passport` client.

To do so, run this command to create a new client. ([more info](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/passport#creating-a-password-grant-client))
```sh
# in your Laravel project
> php artisan passport:client --password



 What should we name the password grant client? [Laravel Password Grant Client]:
 > cool_sidebase_client

 Which user provider should this client use to retrieve users? [users]:
  [0] users
 >

Password grant client created successfully.
Client ID: 1
Client secret: W2kxhy64K7eLMKLYnZmKNOW2YsPomdtyPkVmhRzM
```


2. Re-configuring the `NuxtAuthHandler`

In order to do so, you first need to implement a catch-all `NuxtAuthHandler` in `~/server/api/auth/[...].ts` and configure it like described in [the official `next-auth` docs](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/oauth#using-a-custom-provider)

Here an example:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from "#auth";
const config = useRuntimeConfig()

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  secret: config.NUXT_SECRET,
  providers: [
    {
      id: process.env.CUSTOM_BACKEND_ID,
      name: process.env.CUSTOM_BACKEND_NAME,
      type: "oauth",
      authorization: {
        url: `${process.env.CUSTOM_BACKEND_URL}/oauth/authorize`,
        params: { scope: "" }
      },
      token: `${process.env.CUSTOM_BACKEND_URL}/oauth/token`,
      userinfo: `${process.env.CUSTOM_BACKEND_URL}/api/user`,
      clientId: process.env.CUSTOM_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.CUSTOM_CLIENT_SECRET,
      profile(profile) {
        return profile
      },
    }
  ],
});
```
